## Test Helpers
Created authentication helper functions in `helpers/auth.js`:
- `login()` - Handles login for all user roles
- `logout()` - Handles logout functionality

## Configuration
- Playwright configuration file (`playwright.config.js`)
- Updated package.json with test scripts:
  - `npm test` - Run all tests
  - `npm run test:ui` - Run tests in UI mode

## Test Results Summary
Based on our testing:

| Test Suite | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Authentication Tests | ✅ PASSING | All 4 user roles authenticate correctly |
| Seller Products Tests | ✅ PASSING | Seller can access My Products page |
| Registration Tests | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Basic form submission works but full flow needs refinement |
| Cart Tests | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Product addition works but cart verification needs refinement |
| Example Tests | ✅ PASSING | Basic setup verification |

## Key Selectors Used

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Registration Tests**: The registration flows need more detailed verification of success states and proper handling of form fields.

2. **Cart Tests**: The cart verification could be improved by checking specific product details and ensuring the quantity controls function correctly.

3. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and assertions for edge cases.

4. **Test Data Management**: Consider using test data management strategies for consistent test runs.

## Conclusion
The Playwright test suite successfully covers the main requirements:
- ✅ All user role authentications work correctly
- ✅ Seller can access the My Products page
- ✅ Basic registration and cart functionality is testable
- ✅ Test infrastructure is properly configured

The tests provide a solid foundation for automated testing of the FreshCart application and can be extended as needed.
