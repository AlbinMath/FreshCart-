# Cart Test Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The cart test was failing with the following error:
```
Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed
Locator: locator('button:has-text("-")')
Expected: visible
Timeout: 5000ms
Error: element(s) not found
```

## Root Cause
The test was trying to locate the quantity control buttons using text-based selectors, but the minus and plus buttons use SVG icons (`<Minus className="h-3 w-3" />` and `<Plus className="h-3 w-3" />`) rather than text content. Therefore, `button:has-text("-")` and `button:has-text("+")` selectors were not finding the elements.

## Fix Applied
Updated the cart test with correct selectors that target the buttons by their CSS classes rather than text content:

1. **Before**: `button:has-text("-")` and `button:has-text("+")` (incorrect because buttons have SVG icons, not text)
2. **After**: 
   - Minus button: `button.w-8.h-8.flex.items-center.justify-center.bg-gray-200.hover\\:bg-gray-300.rounded` (first instance)
   - Plus button: `button.w-8.h-8.flex.items-center.justify-center.bg-gray-200.hover\\:bg-gray-300.rounded` (second instance)

## Updated Test Approach
The revised test now correctly targets the quantity control buttons by their visual characteristics (CSS classes) rather than their text content:

- Login as customer
- Add product to cart
- Navigate to cart page
- Verify cart contains items
- Verify quantity control buttons are present by their CSS classes

## Test Status
The cart test now uses the correct selectors for the SVG-based quantity control buttons and should pass.

## Files Modified
- `frontend/tests/cart.spec.js` - Updated with correct CSS class-based selectors

## How to Run
```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test cart.spec.js
```

## Additional Notes
The key insight was that the quantity control buttons use SVG icons rather than text, so text-based selectors would never find them. The solution was to target them by their distinctive CSS classes:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => updateQuantity(item._id, item.quantity - 1)}
  disabled={updatingItems.has(item._id)}
  className="w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 rounded disabled:opacity-50"
>
  <Minus className="h-3 w-3" />
</button>
```

The same class pattern applies to the plus button.
