5. ✅ **Seller Dashboard "My Products" Page Test**
6. ✅ **Registration Flow Test**
7. ✅ **Add to Cart Functionality Test**

## Test Implementation Summary

### Test Files Created
1. `tests/example.spec.js` - Basic example tests to verify setup
2. `tests/auth.spec.js` - Authentication tests for all user roles
3. `tests/seller-products.spec.js` - Seller dashboard and product management tests
4. `tests/registration.spec.js` - User registration flow tests
5. `tests/cart.spec.js` - Shopping cart functionality tests
6. `tests/helpers/auth.js` - Authentication helper functions

### Configuration Files
1. `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration with Chromium browser
2. Updated `package.json` with test scripts:
   - `npm test` - Run all tests
   - `npm run test:ui` - Run tests in UI mode

## Test Details

### Authentication Tests (`auth.spec.js`)
Successfully implemented tests for all four user roles:
- Admin login with verification of dashboard access
- Seller login with verification of store overview
- Delivery login with verification of delivery dashboard
- Customer login with verification of homepage access

### Seller Products Test (`seller-products.spec.js`)
Implemented test to verify seller access to "My Products" page:
- Login as seller
- Navigate to products page
- Verify product form elements
- Verify existing products list

### Registration Tests (`registration.spec.js`)
Implemented basic registration flow tests:
- Customer registration form submission
- Seller registration form submission
- Note: These tests could be enhanced with more detailed verification

### Cart Tests (`cart.spec.js`)
Implemented tests for shopping cart functionality:
- Customer login
- Add product to cart from homepage
- Navigate to cart page
- Verify cart contents
- Check quantity controls

### Helper Functions (`helpers/auth.js`)
Created reusable authentication functions:
- `login(page, email, password, role)` - Handles login for all roles
- `logout(page)` - Handles logout functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- Playwright Test Framework
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- Chromium Browser for testing

### Key Selectors Used
- Admin dashboard: `h1:has-text("Dashboard Overview")`
- Seller dashboard: `h1:has-text("Store Overview")`
- Delivery dashboard: `h1:has-text("Delivery Status")`
- Customer homepage: `h1:has-text("Welcome to FreshCart")`
- My Products page: `h1:has-text("My Products")`
- Cart page: `h1:has-text("Your Cart")`

## How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure FreshCart application is running locally
2. Install Playwright: `npm install -D @playwright/test`
3. Install browsers: `npx playwright install chromium`

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test auth.spec.js

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

## Test Results Summary

During implementation, the following tests were verified to work correctly:

✅ **Authentication Tests** - All user roles can successfully authenticate
✅ **Seller Products Test** - Seller can access My Products page
✅ **Basic Registration Tests** - Form submission works
✅ **Cart Functionality Tests** - Products can be added to cart

Note: Some tests may require refinement for more detailed verification, particularly around registration flows and cart operations.

## Recommendations for Enhancement

1. **Improve Registration Tests**:
   - Add verification of successful registration messages
   - Implement more detailed form validation checks
   - Add tests for duplicate email handling

2. **Enhance Cart Tests**:
   - Add verification of specific product details in cart
   - Implement tests for quantity adjustment functionality
   - Add tests for removing items from cart

3. **Add More Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Order placement and tracking
   - Payment processing flows
   - Admin dashboard functionality
   - Product management operations

4. **Implement Test Data Management**:
   - Use test-specific accounts to avoid conflicts
   - Implement data cleanup between tests
   - Add test data fixtures for consistent results

## Conclusion

The Playwright test suite has been successfully implemented for the FreshCart application, covering all the requested functionality:

1. ✅ Authentication for all user roles (Admin, Seller, Delivery, Customer)
2. ✅ Seller dashboard access to "My Products" page
3. ✅ Registration flows
4. ✅ Shopping cart functionality

The tests provide a solid foundation for automated end-to-end testing of the FreshCart application and can be extended as needed for more comprehensive coverage.
